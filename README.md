## Hi there 👋, I'm [Simone](https://simonedamico.com/)

I'm currently a Technical Team Leader at [Redokun](https://redokun.com/) with over a decade of experience in building large-scale software systems. Passionate about clean code and a strong advocate for Test-Driven Development, I embrace Agile methodologies, Lean principles, and DevOps culture. I share my experiences through the [**Lead Through Mistakes**](https://leadthroughmistakes.substack.com/) newsletter and as speaker at conferences. In my spare time, I’m a full-time dad to two kids and a Lego enthusiast.
